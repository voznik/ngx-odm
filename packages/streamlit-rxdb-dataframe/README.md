<!-- An exception thrown inside a promise will not be caught by a nesting try block due to the asynchronous nature of execution.

Promises are designed to propagate errors to the next error handler or catch() block in the promise chain. Promises are asynchronous and operate outside of the normal call stack. When a Promise is created, it is added to the microtask queue, which is processed after the current call stack has completed. This means that the try-catch block surrounding the Promise will have already completed by the time the Promise is resolved or rejected. Therefore, any error occurring within the Promise will not be caught by the try-catch block.
