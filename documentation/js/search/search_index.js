time to contribute! :tada::+1:\nThe following is a set of guidelines for contributing to @ngx-odm and its packages.\nTable Of Contents\nI don't want to read this whole thing, I just have a question!!!\nHow can I help?\nDeveloping\nBuilding\n\nLinking local version\n\nPublish new version\n\nDev builds\nBeta builds\nRelease builds\n\nCommit Message Guidelines\nI don't want to read this whole thing I just have a question!!!\n\nNote: Please don't file an issue to ask a question.\n\n\nRead Rxdb docs\nAsk a question on stackoverflow.\n\nHow can I help?\nCheck the issues where we have labels for help wanted.\nDeveloping\nStart by installing all dependencies\n...\n\n\n Commit Message Guidelines\nWe have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted. This leads to more\nreadable messages that are easy to follow when looking through the project history. But also,\nwe use the git commit messages to generate the Angular change log.\nCommit Message Format\nEach commit message consists of a header, a body and a footer. The header has a special\nformat that includes a type, a scope and a subject:\nExample :(): \n\n\n\nThe header is mandatory and the scope of the header is optional.\nAny line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier\nto read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.\nThe footer should contain a closing reference to an issue if any.\nSamples: (even more samples)\nExample :docs(changelog): update changelog to beta.5Example :fix(release): need to depend on latest rxjs\n\nThe version in our package.json gets copied to the one we publish, and users need the latest of these.Revert\nIf the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with revert:, followed by the header of the reverted commit.

Which field should be used as primary, which fields should be used as indexes and what should be encrypted. The schema also validates that every inserted document of your collections conforms to the schema. Every collection has its own schema. With RxDB, schemas are defined with the jsonschema-standard which you might know from other projects.\nhttps://rxdb.info/rx-schema.html\n\nExample :import type { RxCollectionCreatorExtended } from '@ngx-odm/rxdb/config';\n// create or import your schema\nconst todoSchema: RxSchema = require('../../../assets/data/todo.schema.json');\n// create config\nconst todoCollectionConfig: RxCollectionCreatorExtended = {\n  name: 'todo', //  {\n      // provide replication state (optional)\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    // ... other imports\n    NgxRxdbModule.forFeature(todoCollectionConfig),\n  ],\n})\nexport class TodosModule {\n  constructor(\n    @Inject(RXDB_COLLECTION) private collectionService: RxDBCollectionService\n  ) {\n    this.collectionService.sync(); // INFO: collection is ready\n  }\n}In your FeatureService\nExample :import { RXDB_COLLECTION } from '@ngx-odm/rxdb';\nimport { RxDBCollectionService } from '@ngx-odm/rxdb/collection';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class TodosService {\n  private collectionService: RxDBCollectionService =\n    inject>(RXDB_COLLECTION);\n  // store & get filter as property of a `local` document\n  filter$ = this.collectionService\n    .getLocal('local', 'filterValue')\n    .pipe(startWith('ALL'), distinctUntilChanged());\n  // get count of documents in collection as observable\n  count$ = this.collectionService.count();\n\n  // get documents from collection as observable\n  // optionally using `RxQuery` mango-queries\n  todos$: Observable = this.collectionService.docs();\n\n  // add new document\n  add(name: string): void {\n    const payload: Todo = { guid: uuid(), name, done: false, dateCreated: Date.now() };\n    this.collectionService.insert(payload);\n  }\n\n  // update property of single document\n  toggle(guid: string, done: boolean): void {\n    this.collectionService.set(guid, { done });\n  }\n\n  // update many documents with partial data by query\n  toggleAllTodos(completed: boolean) {\n    this.collectionService.updateBulk(\n      { selector: { completed: { $eq: !completed } } },\n      { completed }\n    );\n  }\n\n  // remove many dcouments by qeury\n  removeCompletedTodos(): void {\n    this.collectionService.removeBulk({ selector: { completed: true } });\n  }\n  // ...\n}Usage (Standalone)\nIn your main.ts\nExample :import { provideRxDatabase } from '@ngx-odm/rxdb';\nimport { getRxDatabaseCreator } from '@ngx-odm/rxdb/config';\n\nexport const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {\n  providers: [\n    // ... other providers\n    provideRxDatabase(\n      getRxDatabaseCreator({\n        name: 'demo',\n        localDocuments: true,\n        multiInstance: true,\n        ignoreDuplicate: false,\n        storage: getRxStorageDexie(),\n        plugins: [\n          // will be loaded by together with core plugins\n          RxDBDevModePlugin, //  console.error(err));In your Component\nExample :import { provideRxCollection } from '@ngx-odm/rxdb';\n\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  // ...\n  providers: [provideRxCollection(config)],\n})\nexport class StandaloneComponent {\n  readonly todoCollection = inject(NgxRxdbCollectionService);\n}Using sginals & signalStore from @ngrx/signals\nExample :import { signalStore } from '@ngrx/signals';\nimport { withEntities } from '@ngrx/signals/entities';\nimport { withCollectionService } from '@ngx-odm/rxdb/signals';\nimport { withDevtools } from '@angular-architects/ngrx-toolkit';\n\nexport const TodoStore = signalStore(\n  { providedIn: 'root' },\n  withDevtools('todo'),\n  withEntities(),\n  // INFO: an instance of RxCollection will be provided by this\n  withCollectionService({\n    filter: 'ALL' as TodosFilter,\n    collectionConfig: TodosCollectionConfig,\n  }),\n  ...\n);\n\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  // ...\n  providers: [TodoStore],\n})\nexport class StandaloneComponent {\n  readonly todoStore = inject(TodoStore);\n\n  constructor() {\n    effect(() => {\n      const { filter, entities } = this.todoStore;\n    });\n  }\n}Features\nBy using this module you can simplify your work with RxDB in Angular application:\n\nAutomatically initialize db with settings\noptionally provide db dumb to pre-fill collections\noptionally provide array of initial documents to pre-fill collection\noptionally provide remote location for schema and fetch it automatically before create collection (e.g. to maintain single source of truth for schema)\noptionally provide syncronization with remote db (CouchDB, Kinto etc.) as DB options\n\n\nAutomatically initialize RxCollection for each lazy-loaded Feature module / standalone component with config\nWork with documents via NgxRxdbCollectionService with unified methods instead of using RxCollection directly (though you still have access to RxCollection and RxDatabase instance)\nsimple methods to work database & documents (with queries)\nsimple methods to work with local documents\nsimple methods to work with attachments\nsimple replication sync initialization\n\n\nWork with signals and entities with @ngrx/signals and @ngrx/entity (optionally zoneless) (see example)\nPersist collection query (mango-query-syntax) in URL with new plugin query-params-plugin (in demo, set localStorage _ngx_rxdb_queryparams )\nprovide Observable of current URL (automatically for Angular)\nsimple methods to set or patch filter, sort, limit, skip\n\n\n\n\n\nStatus\nProject is: in progress\nInspiration\nProject inspired by\n\nrxdb-angular2-example\nAngular NgRx Material Starter\nThe Angular Library Series from Angular In Depth\nNgRx Toolkit - inspired by Manfred Steyer and created singnals tool by analogy of withDataService from Angular Architects\n\nNotes\nContact\nCreated by @voznik - feel free to contact me!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

your main.ts\nIn your Component\nUsing sginals & signalStore from @ngrx/signals\n\n\nFeatures\nStatus\nInspiration\nNotes\nContact\n\n\n\nGeneral info\nIf you don't want to setup RxDB manually in your next Angular project - just import NgxRxdbModule or go with provideRxDatabase and provideRxCollection if standalone component is your choice.\nTechnologies\n\n\n\nRxDB 16+\nAngular 17+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall\nnpm install @ngx-odm/rxdb\nUsage (NgModule)\nIn your AppModule\nExample :import { NgxRxdbModule } from '@ngx-odm/rxdb';\nimport { getRxDatabaseCreator } from '@ngx-odm/rxdb/config';\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    // ... other imports\n    NgxRxdbModule.forRoot(\n      getRxDatabaseCreator({\n        name: 'demo', // In your FeatureModule\n\nSchemas define how your data looks. Which field should be used as primary, which fields should be used as indexes and what should be encrypted. The schema also validates that every inserted document of your collections conforms to the schema. Every collection has its own schema. With RxDB, schemas are defined with the jsonschema-standard which you might know from other projects.\nhttps://rxdb.info/rx-schema.html\n\nExample :import type { RxCollectionCreatorExtended } from '@ngx-odm/rxdb/config';\n// create or import your schema\nconst todoSchema: RxSchema = require('../../../assets/data/todo.schema.json');\n// create config\nconst todoCollectionConfig: RxCollectionCreatorExtended = {\n  name: 'todo', //  {\n      // provide replication state (optional)\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    // ... other imports\n    NgxRxdbModule.forFeature(todoCollectionConfig),\n  ],\n})\nexport class TodosModule {\n  constructor(\n    @Inject(RXDB_COLLECTION) private collectionService: RxDBCollectionService\n  ) {\n    this.collectionService.sync(); // INFO: collection is ready\n  }\n}In your FeatureService\nExample :import { RXDB_COLLECTION } from '@ngx-odm/rxdb';\nimport { RxDBCollectionService } from '@ngx-odm/rxdb/collection';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class TodosService {\n  private collectionService: RxDBCollectionService =\n    inject>(RXDB_COLLECTION);\n  // store & get filter as property of a `local` document\n  filter$ = this.collectionService\n    .getLocal('local', 'filterValue')\n    .pipe(startWith('ALL'), distinctUntilChanged());\n  // get count of documents in collection as observable\n  count$ = this.collectionService.count();\n\n  // get documents from collection as observable\n  // optionally using `RxQuery` mango-queries\n  todos$: Observable = this.collectionService.docs();\n\n  // add new document\n  add(name: string): void {\n    const payload: Todo = { guid: uuid(), name, done: false, dateCreated: Date.now() };\n    this.collectionService.insert(payload);\n  }\n\n  // update property of single document\n  toggle(guid: string, done: boolean): void {\n    this.collectionService.set(guid, { done });\n  }\n\n  // update many documents with partial data by query\n  toggleAllTodos(completed: boolean) {\n    this.collectionService.updateBulk(\n      { selector: { completed: { $eq: !completed } } },\n      { completed }\n    );\n  }\n\n  // remove many dcouments by qeury\n  removeCompletedTodos(): void {\n    this.collectionService.removeBulk({ selector: { completed: true } });\n  }\n  // ...\n}Usage (Standalone)\nIn your main.ts\nExample :import { provideRxDatabase } from '@ngx-odm/rxdb';\nimport { getRxDatabaseCreator } from '@ngx-odm/rxdb/config';\n\nexport const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {\n  providers: [\n    // ... other providers\n    provideRxDatabase(\n      getRxDatabaseCreator({\n        name: 'demo',\n        localDocuments: true,\n        multiInstance: true,\n        ignoreDuplicate: false,\n        storage: getRxStorageDexie(),\n        plugins: [\n          // will be loaded by together with core plugins\n          RxDBDevModePlugin, //  console.error(err));In your Component\nExample :import { provideRxCollection } from '@ngx-odm/rxdb';\n\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  // ...\n  providers: [provideRxCollection(config)],\n})\nexport class StandaloneComponent {\n  readonly todoCollection = inject(NgxRxdbCollectionService);\n}Using sginals & signalStore from @ngrx/signals\nExample :import { signalStore } from '@ngrx/signals';\nimport { withEntities } from '@ngrx/signals/entities';\nimport { withCollectionService } from '@ngx-odm/rxdb/signals';\nimport { withDevtools } from '@angular-architects/ngrx-toolkit';\n\nexport const TodoStore = signalStore(\n  { providedIn: 'root' },\n  withDevtools('todo'),\n  withEntities(),\n  // INFO: an instance of RxCollection will be provided by this\n  withCollectionService({\n    filter: 'ALL' as TodosFilter,\n    collectionConfig: TodosCollectionConfig,\n  }),\n  ...\n);\n\n@Component({\n  standalone: true,\n  // ...\n  providers: [TodoStore],\n})\nexport class StandaloneComponent {\n  readonly todoStore = inject(TodoStore);\n\n  constructor() {\n    effect(() => {\n      const { filter, entities } = this.todoStore;\n    });\n  }\n}Features\nBy using this module you can simplify your work with RxDB in Angular application:\n\nAutomatically initialize db with settings\noptionally provide db dumb to pre-fill collections\noptionally provide array of initial documents to pre-fill collection\noptionally provide remote location for schema and fetch it automatically before create collection (e.g. to maintain single source of truth for schema)\noptionally provide syncronization with remote db (CouchDB, Kinto etc.) as DB options\n\n\nAutomatically initialize RxCollection for each lazy-loaded Feature module / standalone component with config\nWork with documents via NgxRxdbCollectionService with unified methods instead of using RxCollection directly (though you still have access to RxCollection and RxDatabase instance)\nsimple methods to work database & documents (with queries)\nsimple methods to work with local documents\nsimple methods to work with attachments\nsimple replication sync initialization\n\n\nWork with signals and entities with @ngrx/signals and @ngrx/entity (optionally zoneless) (see example)\nPersist collection query (mango-query-syntax) in URL with new plugin query-params-plugin (in demo, set localStorage _ngx_rxdb_queryparams )\nprovide Observable of current URL (automatically for Angular)\nsimple methods to set or patch filter, sort, limit, skip\n\n\n\n\n\nStatus\nProject is: in progress\nInspiration\nProject inspired by\n\nrxdb-angular2-example\nAngular NgRx Material Starter\nThe Angular Library Series from Angular In Depth\nNgRx Toolkit - inspired by Manfred Steyer and created singnals tool by analogy of withDataService from Angular Architects\n\nNotes\nContact\nCreated by @voznik - feel free to contact me!\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching
